# **Doom Mapper**

Doom Mapper is a full stack Web application that allows users to check if a building in San Francisco is in danger of collapse in a 7.0 or higher earthquake.

The application has 93% test coverage using Python unittest.

This project was made at Hackbright Academy in San Francisco over four weeks in February 2020.

#### Search for an address in San Francisco to learn about the seismic risks facing it. If the building is in the database as soft story building or a skyscraper, it will return info about the liquefaction risk, any known flawed construction used, and if the building has been seismically retrofitted.
